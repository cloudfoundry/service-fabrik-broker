To bring in a new provisioner, one has to bring in their own service and plans as described [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/service-fabrik-broker/blob/master/docs/Interoperator.md#service-and-plan-registration). Service Fabrik defines `SFService` and `SFSplans` which are the [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) defined by the framework. The structure of these CRDs are well described [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/service-fabrik-broker/blob/master/docs/Interoperator.md#service-fabrik-inter-operator-custom-resources).

1. Add your services, similar to [this](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/service-fabrik-broker/blob/master/broker/config/settings.yml#L525-L550) and 
plans similar to [this](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/service-fabrik-broker/blob/master/broker/config/settings.yml#L685-L748).

2. Make sure the templates are added properly in the plan metadata, simialr to [this](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/service-fabrik-broker/blob/master/broker/config/settings.yml#L736-L748).

3. Start your operator and do the following:

   1. Register the CRD with Service Fabrik APIServer.
   2. Start watching on the CRD for state change.
   3. Process create/update/delete depending  on the state change.
